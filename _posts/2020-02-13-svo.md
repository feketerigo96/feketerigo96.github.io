The [original SVO](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_svo) cannot been used for live camera.(It's too difficult to rearrange its code for live camera with plain cmake, and with ROS the program always crashed.)<br/>

So we choose the improved version [svo_edgelet](https://github.com/HeYijia/svo_edgelet). But it is base on OpenCV 2.4.X, when using OpenCV 3.4.X the compiling error occurs. We don't considered using OpenCV 2.4.X as a good solution, so we make some changes to the code to adapt it to OpenCV 3.4.X.<br/>

We need to modify the following four places.<br/>
1. In [feature_detection.cpp line28](https://github.com/HeYijia/svo_edgelet/blob/master/src/feature_detection.cpp#L28), change <code>cv::format(data,"CSV")</code> to <code>cv::format(data,cv::Formatter::FMT_CSV)</code>, according to [this website](https://qiita.com/wakaba130/items/ae7cdd4b9a9c38fbc971).<br/>

2. In [precomp.hpp line52](https://github.com/HeYijia/svo_edgelet/blob/master/include/precomp.hpp#L52), delete<code>#include "opencv2/core/internal.hpp"</code> and add <code>#include "opencv2/opencv.hpp"</code>.<br/>

3. In [five-point.cpp](https://github.com/HeYijia/svo_edgelet/blob/master/src/five-point.cpp), there is outdated using of transforming <code>CvMat*</code> to <code>Mat</code>. Change all the <code>cv::Mat(CvMat*)</code> format into <code>cv::cvarrToMat(CvMat*)</code>, according to [this website](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_38213410/article/details/89522583).<br/>

4. In [modelest.cpp line191](https://github.com/HeYijia/svo_edgelet/blob/master/src/modelest.cpp#L191), according to [this website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30991658/upgrading-from-opencv-2-4-to-opencv-3-0/48227355). The <code>CV_IMPLEMENT_QSORT</code> function is out of date, so we can change it into <br/>

```
static void icvSortDistances(int *array, size_t total, int )
{
    std::sort(&array[0], &array[total]);
}
```
