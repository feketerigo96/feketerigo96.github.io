The [original SVO](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_svo) cannot been used for live camera.(It's too difficult to rearrange its code for live camera with plain cmake, and with ROS the program always crashed.)<br/>

So we choose the improved version [svo_edgelet](https://github.com/HeYijia/svo_edgelet). But it is base on OpenCV 2.4.X, when using OpenCV 3.4.X the compiling error occurs. We don't considered using OpenCV 2.4.X as a good solution, so we make some changes to the code to adapt it to OpenCV 3.4.X.<br/>
